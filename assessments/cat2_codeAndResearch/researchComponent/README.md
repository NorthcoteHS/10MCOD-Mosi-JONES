# researchProject

Part 2 of your CAT is to research a computer science or programming topic that interests you, in pairs or individually, and create a report of your choice.

## Description

Choose a computer science or programming topic to research.

You will be graded on each of the following sections:
- **About:** Tell us about the topic - what is it? How is it used?
- **Highlights:** What is most exciting or interesting about this topic?
- **History:** How long has the field been around? Who started it and why? What motivated it's creation/discovery?
- **Impact:** What impact does it have on everyday life, the future of technology/computing, or other fields of study? Use examples.
- **Bibliography:** List your sources using an appropriate citation format. You should have at least 3 different sources.

You may present your project in (almost) any way you like. A simple report will do, but you may also wish to do a presentation, video, poster, pamphlet, cartoon, podcast, Python program, etc.. You must address all of the categories thoroughly in whichever format you choose. We recommend using the headings provided to make it easy to locate your answers.

There is a list and brief description of some possible options below. **Note:** If you choose a different topic, it must be approved by your teacher first!

| Topic  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Aritificial Intelligence  | AI is when computers seem to make intelligent decisions or behaviour, such as playing chess, Siri, image recognition, self-driving cars, etc.   |
| Machine Learning  | Machine learning involves training a computer to solve a problem (such as classifying items based on pictures) by providing it large amounts of examples and having it identify patterns.  |
| Cryptography  | The modern world relies on the protection of personal, organisational and governmental information. Most data such as finances, private messages, nuclear codes, etc. is protected by encryption, so that only authorised people can view it.  |
| Networking  | The process of connecting two or more computers together.  |
| Data Mining  | Data mining is not looking for data, rather it's looking through large amounts of data in the hopes of identifying patterns and learning about the data as a whole.  |
| Compiling/Machine Code  | Your computer can only run your Python program if you have Python installed and you *compile* it. If the computer doesn't understand Python by default, what *does* it understand?  |
| Bioinformatics  | Computers are much better at doing tedious and complex tasks than humans. Bioinformatics involves using computers to look for patterns, anomalies, genes, etc. in complex biological structures.  |
| The Turing Test  | The Turing Test (proposed by Alan Turing) is a way to test AI. A very good AI could theoretically fool a human into believing it is human.  |
| Quantum Computing  | Most computers operate on the idea of binary, true/false, on/off states. Quantum computing throws this whole idea for a loop and could theoretically blow the limits of modern computing out of the water.  |
| Geographic Information Systems  | GISs manage geographic data for maps and GPS as well as more scientific geographic properties such as topology.  |
| Virtual/Augmented Reality  | VR and AR allow the user to experience computer generated scenarios in a more immersive way. It's used for more than just video games!  |
| Human-Computer Interaction  | HCI studies the interactions between people and computers. It helps us learn about the computers and ourselves, while also giving us ideas for designing better computer systems.  |

## Assessment

The rubric for the research project of the CAT can be found [here](../researchRubric.pdf).

Please note the [school information on plagiarism](http://schoolbox.nhs.vic.edu.au/homepage/14767) - plagiarism will not be tolerated in any form. This includes copying information from websites without properly citing the sources, as well as sharing or copying material between classmates. This activity is to be completed individually or in pairs - reports should not be shared between groups.

## Extension

Your project will be considered above level if you demonstrate a deeper degree of understanding of the motivations and impacts of the field. Connections to other fields such as health, science, military, education, etc. including examples would be one way to show this. Well researched, well explained, well summarised, and/or well presented projects may also be considered above level.
